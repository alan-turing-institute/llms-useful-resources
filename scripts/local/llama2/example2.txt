*Main Contributions of Proactive Monitoring of AI Fairness Project*

The project brings three main UK-based contributions: (1) Our code analysis tool will assist developers with limited experience in aligning technical development with relevant legal implications such as the Equality Act, UK GDPR, and Data Protection Act. (2) Our expert group meeting will lead a policy briefing/whitepaper addressing fair AI development practices in SME context. Our institute's strong ties with AI Standards Hub, Ada Lovelace Institute, and CDEI, ensure impactful dissemination. We will actively share findings through the Turing Way open-source community, fostering engagement with diverse groups. (3) Our open-source outputs and tailored educational content for SMEs will facilitate widespread adoption in the UK and beyond.
